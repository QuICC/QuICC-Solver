/** \page mhdPDevBoundary Boundary conditions
 *
 * The implementation of boundary conditions within the quasi-inverse framework requires care. 
 *
 *    - The quasi-inverse factor should be included in the boundary conditions where possible
 *    - The ordering is important in cases where some fields don't have boundary conditions but still need to free boundary rows in coupled systems.
 *      The quasi-inverse should be applied to the dimension that has boundary conditions and leave the identity to the "unconstrained dimension.
 *    - The condition number of the matrix might depend strongly on the way the corners are distributed among the boundary conditions.
